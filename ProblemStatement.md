A. Create widgets giving meaningful insights.
  a. Create widgets that answer the following questions
    1. What are the top and least rented (in-demand) genres and what are their total sales?
    2. Can we know how many distinct users have rented each genre?
    3. What is the average rental rate for each genre? (from the highest to the lowest)
    4. How many rented films were returned late, early, and on time?
    5. In which countries do ‘Rent A Film’ have a presence and what is the customer base in each country? What are the total sales in each country? (from most to least)
    6. Who are the top 5 customers per total sales and can we get their details just in case ‘Rent A Film’ wants to reward them?
  b. Create widgets which show the total sales in terms of film, film_actors, category, language etc
  c. Create widgets which show which stores are making the highest sales and drill down further by staff.

B. Create a Dashboard from the above widgets
  The dashboard should have the following capabilities
  1. A World Map that would highlight sales in different countries and can be further drilled down to cities.
  2. Time range widgets consisting of years can be drilled down to quarters, months and days.
  3. The selection of one of the dimensions on the dashboard should filter the other widgets.
  4. Use intermediate-level DAX functions wherever necessary.
  5. Create separate custom time range filters, country filters, actor filters, etc.
  6. Use parameters within the dashboard For eg Top N actors where a parameter would specify N
  7. Insert ‘go to sheet’ and URL actions, if possible with your widgets
  8. Create a presentable dashboard with the company logo, proper formatting etc.

C. Create a pbix file for this.
